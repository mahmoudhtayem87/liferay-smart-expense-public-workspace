# AI Expense Management Application

One practical example of Liferayâ€™s low-code capabilities is developing a full-featured expense management application. This application utilizes AI to scan receipts and extract relevant information, significantly streamlining the expense reporting process.

## Key Features:
- Receipt Upload: Users can easily upload scanned receipts.
- AI Integration: The application uses AI-powered Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract key details from receipts, such as total amount, vendor name, and date.
- Expense Tracking: Extracted data is automatically categorized and stored, allowing users to generate reports and track expenses effectively.

## Implementation Details:
- Data Structures: I used Liferay Objects to build the data structures necessary for managing expense reports and receipt data.
- Processes: Liferay Process Builder facilitated the creation of workflows to streamline the expense submission and approval processes.
- Transactions: I leveraged Liferay Headless to enable seamless transactions with Liferay objects, ensuring that data flows efficiently throughout the application.
- Technology Stack: Notably, I did not need any Liferay-specific technology stack knowledge. For the backend, I used Node.js, and for the frontend, I utilized React.js to create a responsive user interface.
